      "whyVisit": "Half Dome is the ultimate Yosemite day hike - the one you can't die without doing, and the one you're most likely to die while doing. It's got 900 feet (300 meters) worth of spectacular waterfalls at the bottom if you take the Mist Trail route; bigger-than-life panoramic vistas at the top; and a knee-knocking, hand-clamming cable ascent that will test your courage, your strength, and the tread on your shoes.",
      "description": "Rising nearly 5,000 feet above Yosemite Valley and 8,800 feet above sea level, Half Dome is a Yosemite icon and a great challenge to many hikers. Despite an 1865 report declaring that it was perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of the prominent points about the Yosemite which never has been, and never will be, trodden by human foot, George Anderson reached the summit in 1875, in the process laying the predecessor to today's cable route. Today, thousands of people reach the summit. For most, it is an exciting, arduous hike; for a few, it becomes more of an adventure than they wanted. Indeed, park rangers assist hundreds of people on the Half Dome trail every summer. Most of these emergencies could have been prevented... read on to learn how. Much of the hike to Half Dome is an adventure into Wilderness, and, while there is nothing you can do to guarantee your safety, below you will find some tips to reduce your risk and have a safer, more enjoyable hike.",

      "difficultyExplained": "Call it a 4 out of 10 going down and 7 out of 10 going up. The trail is wide and smooth, and not nearly so steep as Upper Yosemite Falls, whose own valley-floor-to-valley-rim trail is a mile shorter. By the time you finish the second set of switchbacks on the way up, though, you'll know you've been on a hike",
      "bestTime": "Yosemite Falls is a big factor in the scenery here, and it looks best in the spring, when snowmelt is at its peak. The view looking west to Cathedral Rocks and El Capitan tends to get hazy some days (especially noticeable if you're photographing it), and will be better if you can do it on a clear day or early in the morning. There's enough to see here, though, that the trail's enjoyable any time it's open. (Note that it's usually closed in the winter, and might not open in the spring until the Glacier Point Road opens, generally in May - see the park service's Wilderness Conditions Trail Update page to see if it's listed among the currently closed trails.)",
      "family-friendly": false,
      "elevationGain": 3200,
      "whyVisit": "Because this is where Yosemite Falls gives you the full monty. And if you hike it from bottom to top, you can buy yourself an ice cream at trail's end",
      "description": "There may be no better way to see what's so fabulous about Yosemite Valley than to hike the Four-Mile Trail, which climbs from the valley floor near the Swinging Bridge to the south valley rim at Glacier Point (or vice versa, or both, depending on your inclination). This hike offers great views of most of the landmarks that Yosemite Valley's famous for, and all from angles you're not used to seeing on postcards. It's a trail that connects Yosemite's two most popular spots - Yosemite Valley and Glacier Point - so it will have lots of hikers. There are memorable views around nearly every corner, though, so people won't be piling up at any particular spot.",
      "hazards": "Start your hike early; this trail can become very hot mid-day. By starting as early as possible, you will be able to spend more of the hike in shade and less in the sun. Stay on the trail and resist the temptation to cut switchbacks. Cutting switchbacks is illegal, and there are many drop-offs and ledges hidden by brush.Sprained ankles are common on this trail. It is partially paved and has loose sand on top, which makes for slippery footing in places.",
