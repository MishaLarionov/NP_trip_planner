      "difficultyExplained": "Call it a 4 out of 10 going down and 7 out of 10 going up. The trail is wide and smooth, and not nearly so steep as Upper Yosemite Falls, whose own valley-floor-to-valley-rim trail is a mile shorter. By the time you finish the second set of switchbacks on the way up, though, you'll know you've been on a hike",
      "bestTime": "Yosemite Falls is a big factor in the scenery here, and it looks best in the spring, when snowmelt is at its peak. The view looking west to Cathedral Rocks and El Capitan tends to get hazy some days (especially noticeable if you're photographing it), and will be better if you can do it on a clear day or early in the morning. There's enough to see here, though, that the trail's enjoyable any time it's open. (Note that it's usually closed in the winter, and might not open in the spring until the Glacier Point Road opens, generally in May - see the park service's Wilderness Conditions Trail Update page to see if it's listed among the currently closed trails.)",

      "elevation-gain": 3200,
      "whyVisit": "Because this is where Yosemite Falls gives you the full monty. And if you hike it from bottom to top, you can buy yourself an ice cream at trail's end",
      "description": "There may be no better way to see what's so fabulous about Yosemite Valley than to hike the Four-Mile Trail, which climbs from the valley floor near the Swinging Bridge to the south valley rim at Glacier Point (or vice versa, or both, depending on your inclination). This hike offers great views of most of the landmarks that Yosemite Valley's famous for, and all from angles you're not used to seeing on postcards. It's a trail that connects Yosemite's two most popular spots - Yosemite Valley and Glacier Point - so it will have lots of hikers. There are memorable views around nearly every corner, though, so people won't be piling up at any particular spot.",
      "hazards": "Start your hike early; this trail can become very hot mid-day. By starting as early as possible, you will be able to spend more of the hike in shade and less in the sun. Stay on the trail and resist the temptation to cut switchbacks. Cutting switchbacks is illegal, and there are many drop-offs and ledges hidden by brush.Sprained ankles are common on this trail. It is partially paved and has loose sand on top, which makes for slippery footing in places.",
